h1 Welcome to space. '

You've been in a cryostatic state for the past 9 years onboard a spaceship travelling
roughly 14 times the speed of light, which puts you among stars of a different galaxy.

Say hello to HAL9000, your artificial support team and only companion. He only wants
what's best for you, so do listen to his advice.

# Chatbot!
##Josh's project features
I started by experimenting with different styling of the DOM elements. I changed the borders to have a radius, made some space in some places. The background image that looks like an electronic eye was cool, so I added another and aligned them to either side of the header. When you load the page, Hal is the first greet the user. When the user responds, Hal "thinks" before continuing, based on the length of the users response. If the user did not greet Hal in any way, Hal is annoyed, and basically says "WTF?" Otherwise, Hal says something nice and the convo continues. I used a random component to choose between three things, but then disabled it while trying to use the regex condition. Were I to continue, I would add the same text as either Dave or Hal enters to both divs, but change the text color in the other side's div to match the background. This way I would keep both responses at the height that makes sense.

## Our favorite AI nemesis, HAL9000 vs. Dave Bowman

* Construct a chatbot that responds to various inputs from Dave
* Feel free to use the HTML and CSS scaffolds or construct your own
* Be creative with your logic and responses!
* Feel free to also change the characters and anything in the starter codeâ€”be creative!

## Grading Rubric (Pass/Partial/Fail)

### Required

* Have the AI respond to user input
* Do at least 3 different things
* One of the commands must utilize the list of people in the class to send a reply
* Use at least 1 conditional to change the response
* Leverage a for loop to iterate over a collection
* Use a random component
* Go above and beyond simple `if/else` statements

### Stretch Goals

* Have 2 or more AIs responding based upon user input
* Use a regular expression to parse and manipulate the response
* Have a conversation between two AIs (without creating an infinite loop!)

## Deliverables

* A working chatbot hosted somewhere publicly accessible (CodePen, Github Pages, etc.)
* A new git respository containing your code
* A `README.md` file with explanations of what your bot does, what commands it responds to, the approach taken, unsolved problems, etc.
